# CH4Net üõ∞Ô∏è

A fast, simple model for detection of methane plumes. For more information see our paper at https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2023/egusphere-2023-563/

## Data
Data are available from zenodo at https://zenodo.org/deposit/8267966. 

## Training
To train CH4Net with all sentinel-2 bands as predictors
```
python3 train.py 12 {output directory}
```
To train CH4Net with only bands 11 and 12 as predictors
```
python3 train.py 2 {output directory}
```
